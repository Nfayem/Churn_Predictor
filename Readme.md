   - Ensure that all features work as expected.
   - Fix any bugs or issues that arise during development.

2. **Containerization**:
   - Create a `Dockerfile` to define your app’s environment and dependencies.
   - Build the Docker image and test it locally to ensure that it works in the containerized environment.
   - Use Docker Compose if needed to manage complex setups with multiple services.

3. **Deployment**:
   - Push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
   - Deploy the containerized app to a production environment or cloud service.

4. **Testing**:
   - Test the containerized app in staging or a test environment to ensure it behaves as expected before production deployment.
