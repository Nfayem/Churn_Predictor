## Usage
Once installed, the app can be accessed via your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`. The homepage provides an overview of the app and the the team of developers behind its production. A history page is available to provide an overview of your current data and churn predictions.

### Screenshots
(Optional: Add screenshots of the app here to visually guide users.)

For your Churn Predictor app's README, here are some recommended screenshots to include:

1. **Home Page**: Show the main interface that users see when they first access the app. This can include the login page or the dashboard if users are already logged in.

2. **Dashboard Overview**: Capture a screenshot of the analytics dashboard showing key metrics, graphs, and data visualizations related to customer churn.

3. **Prediction Results**: Show the page where the churn predictions are displayed, highlighting how the app presents the predicted churn risk for customers.

4. **Data Management**: Include a screenshot of the data overview section, demonstrating how users can manage and view their datasets.

5. **History Page**: Capture the history page where users can see past predictions and historical data trends.

6. **Model Training & Evaluation**: If the app includes a feature for model training and evaluation, include a screenshot of this process, showing the model's performance metrics.

7. **Team Section**: A screenshot showing the team section could also be useful, especially if the app emphasizes collaboration.

These screenshots will provide a comprehensive visual guide to potential users, helping them understand the app's functionality and features.
